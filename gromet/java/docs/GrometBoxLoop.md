# GrometBoxLoop

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**condition** | **Integer** | The index to the entry in the BF table (array) of *this* GrometFN representing the loop condition Predicate of the Loop.  |  [optional]
**init** | **Integer** | The index to the entry in the BF table (array) of *this* GrometFN representing the init (Function) of the Loop. This is primarily for the support of for-loops, cases where most languages have provided an extension to loops that have an initialization that is only in the scope of the loop, but not part of the loop body.  |  [optional]
**body** | **Integer** | The index to the entry in the BF table (array) of *this* GrometFN representing the body (Function) of the Loop.  |  [optional]
